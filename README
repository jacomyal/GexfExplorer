I. INTRODUCTION

This open-source free web widget allows webmasters to offer to the user a simple interface to explore their own graphs. To do this, you first have to spatialize and export your graph in gexf format (www.gexf.com), and the best way is currently Gephi (www.gephi.org), a free software to visualize graphs.
When it's done, the next step is as simple: You must download 'bin/GexfExplorer1.0.swf' (available on www.github.com/jacomyal/GexfExplorer), put it and your gexf-encoded graph somewhere locally in your server, and write the following lines in your html code to use it:

<object width="[your_width_value]" height="[your_height_value]">
	<param name="movie" value="[your_local_GexfExplorer_path]?path=[your_local_graph_path]&[variable1_name]=[variable1_value]" />
	<param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" />
	<param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" />
	<param name="bgcolor" value="#[your_hexa_backgroundcolor]" />
	<embed src="[your_local_GexfExplorer_path]?path=[your_local_graph_path]&[variable1_name]=[variable1_value]" allowfullscreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" width="[your_width_value]" height="[your_height_value]" bgcolor="#[your_hexa_backgroundcolor]">
	</embed>
</object>
