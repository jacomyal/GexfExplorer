I. INTRODUCTION

This open-source free web widget allows webmasters to offer to the user a simple interface to explore their own graphs. To do this, you first have to spatialize and export your graph in gexf format (www.gexf.net), and the best way is currently Gephi (www.gephi.org), a free software to visualize graphs.
When it's done, the next step is as simple: You must download 'bin/GexfExplorer1.0.swf' (available on www.github.com/jacomyal/GexfExplorer), put it and your gexf-encoded graph somewhere locally in your server, and write the following lines in your html code to use it:

<object width="[your_width_value]" height="[your_height_value]">
	<param name="movie" value="[your_local_GexfExplorer_path]?path=[your_local_graph_path]&[variable1_name]=[variable1_value]" />
	<param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" />
	<param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" />
	<param name="bgcolor" value="#[your_hexa_backgroundcolor]" />
	<embed src="[your_local_GexfExplorer_path]?path=[your_local_graph_path]&[variable1_name]=[variable1_value]" allowfullscreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" width="[your_width_value]" height="[your_height_value]" bgcolor="#[your_hexa_backgroundcolor]">
	</embed>
</object>


II. LIST OF CURRENTLY EXISTING PARAMETERS

 .path (String):
	The path of your gexf file    /!\ NECESSARY /!\.
 
 .titleColor (0x******, uint, default=0x000000):
	Now, you can display the title and the author of a graph on stage. To do this, look at http://gexf.net/format/, and use the meta, creator and description balises. If you put those in your file, then title and author will be displayed on stage, with the color indicated by titleColor.

 .curvedEdges (Boolean, default=false):
	'true': edges are clockwise curved; 'false': edges are linear, colored as the source node.
 .clickableNodes (Boolean, default=false):
	If your label are URLs, you can make it 'true', and clicking on a node opens this URL in a new tab (only if label looks like an URL).
 .scaledTextSize (Boolean, default=true):
	'true': Labels size is proportional to nodes size; 'false': Labels size is independant of any other factor.
 .fps (Boolean, default=false):
	'true': The FPS are displayed in the top-left of the stage; 'false': nothing.
 
 .labelsColor (0x******, uint, default=0x000000):
	The color of your labels (0x[your_hexa_label_color], example: Black = 0x000000, White = 0xFFFFFF, ...).
 .font (String, default=Arial):
	The font of your labels ('Arial', 'Verdana', ...)
 
 .edgesThickness(Number, default=1):
	The integer thickness of your edges.
 .edgesColor (0x******, uint, default=[source_node_color]):
	The color of your edges. If you want edges color to be the same as source node, don't define this parameter.
	

III. FUNCTIONALITIES

Currently, there isn't a lot of functionalities... You can zoom towards your cursor with your mouse wheel, and move the graph with arrow keys.
And when your fullscreened, you can change your nodes size with a slider, it may be usefull is large graphs, to explore them more locally.


IV. COMPLETE EXAMPLE

Download 'bin/*' in a folder, and launch in your web browser 'bin/test.html' (or download everything, and launch it). Then, you'll have a simple demo of this widget, with the following html code:

<object width="550" height="400">
	<param name="movie" value="GexfExplorer1.0.swf?path=./test.gexf&curvedEdges=true&clickableNodes&clickableNodes=true&labelsColor=0x454545&font=Verdana" />
	<param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" />
	<param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" />
	<param name="bgcolor" value="#000000" />
	<embed src="GexfExplorer1.0.swf?path=./test.gexf&curvedEdges=true&clickableNodes=true&labelsColor=0x454545&font=Verdana" allowfullscreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" width="550" height="400" bgcolor="#000000">
	</embed>
</object>
